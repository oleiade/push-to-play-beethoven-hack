# push-to-play-beethoven-hack

This is the hack I've put together for the Europython 2016 pusher contest.

The principle is that you can press a button in rhythm, and your browser will play the notes, and display the lyrics along the way.

This was built using the Web Audio API, the MIDI.js library, and the pusher.com api.

## Look at that beauty

## Running it

1. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
2. visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)
3. Push that button!
